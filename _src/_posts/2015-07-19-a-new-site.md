title: I Built A New Site, Again
breadcrumb: New Site!
---
## I updated my site a few weeks ago (it looked very similar to this). It was rushed for no reason, and I wasn't very happy with it. In the last few weeks, I rebuilt [Svbstrate](http://github.com/estrattonbailey/svbstrate) completely – and learned a ton – so I decided to make a new site. But better this time.

This theme is available to download as well. I'm calling it "Nominal". I like the way it sounds, and this theme is supposed to be out of the way, but worth noting. This site is a demo essentially, so check out the code over at it's source [repo](http://github.com/estrattonbailey/Nominal).
