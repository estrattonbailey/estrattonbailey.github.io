title: My Site, Now on Github
---

Three months ago, I updated my site to its previous version. The first section of it was then promptly ripped off (I'm talking only a couple days later). I can take that as a compliment, I think.

Four months ago I started development on a site for my previous work family: [Sculpt](http://wearesculpt.com). It was a project that I began designing over a year ago, and a month ago – and 124 hours later – I finished my first complete modular Wordpress theme, now published on their site.

Five months ago I wrote my last blog post. It was about the difference between being busy and being effective. It was horribly preachy and barely thought out. I stand behind the thoughts therein, however, and I think I've improved. I'm still consuming books at an unprecedented rate, and for the last month I've been sticking strictly to the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) at work. I think I've become more focused, more efficient, and less stressed. 

Six months ago I was a designer from Iowa fresh off the boat in New York City, ready to begin a job as a full-time developer. It was cold (January), I was inexperienced (still am), and I had never been more excited.

Prior to that, in reverse order, I was a social media community manager, a photographer, a videographer, a "Creative Director" (yikes), a bus driver, a handyman, a developer (no I wasn't), a bartender, another "Creative Director" (yikes yikes), and finally a designer, way back at my humble roots just over three years ago at a little startup magazine at the University of Iowa.

## So what now?
For the last two years or so I've updated my site every few months to reflect where I was at with my design and development skills. For the last six months I've grown exponentially as a developer and have had the privilege of working with an incredible team at [Barrel](http://barrelny.com). 

So it was time to update my site to something where I can share these experiences, and keep track of the things I'm working on. 

This site is built on [Substrate](http://github.com/estrattonbailey/svbstrate) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on GitHub.

If I don't write at least one post in the next month, [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/estrattonbailey) and tell me to get my shit together.
