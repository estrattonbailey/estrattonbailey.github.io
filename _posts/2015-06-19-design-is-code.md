As web designers we often find ourselves using the same patterns over and over again. Grids, lists, modals, buttons. We create paragraph and character styles for each project. Color palettes, style guides, branding docs. On and on.

We do this because we're smart. Right? Creating simple reusable templates can allow us to work faster while maintaining consistency. And so our tools have evolved to fit these needs.

## Why Design is Code

Imagine you're a web designer starting a project. Clean slate. You start by setting your grid to fit the needs of the project. Then, you move on to color palettes,  character styles, buttons. 

Maybe you used a similar grid in a previous project: `CMD+O`, `CMD+C`, `CMD+V` – you copy and paste it into your new project. If you're using Sketch you make your repeatable elements into symbols. Then you pull up the brief and copy + paste yourself to a 437MB masterpiece.

Next project, you harvest those reusable elements from the last: paragraph styles, colors, buttons. You’re off to the races!

**You just made a framework.** And for many web designers, the next step is to wait for Dropbox to sync the file to your developer so that they can *redo everything you just did* in CSS and HTML.
